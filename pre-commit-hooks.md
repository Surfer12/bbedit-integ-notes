Okay, here is comprehensive documentation of the pre-commit hooks found in the `analysis-of-prompts-v0.2` project, based on the provided configuration file.

# Pre-commit Hooks Documentation: `analysis-of-prompts-v0.2`

## Overview

The `analysis-of-prompts-v0.2` project utilizes pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality and consistency. Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run automatically before each commit, checking for various issues such as formatting errors, large file additions, and adherence to coding standards. This ensures that only clean, well-formatted code is committed to the repository.

The configuration for these hooks is defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.


```1:29:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black

```


## Installed Hooks

The following pre-commit hooks are installed and configured in this project:

### 1. `pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks`

This repository provides a set of essential hooks for common tasks.


```2:8:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
```


-   **`trailing-whitespace`**: Trims trailing whitespace from files.
    
```5:5:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
      - id: trailing-whitespace
```

-   **`end-of-file-fixer`**: Ensures that files end with a newline character.
    
```6:6:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
```

-   **`check-yaml`**: Validates YAML files for syntax errors.
    
```7:7:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
      - id: check-yaml
```

-   **`check-added-large-files`**: Prevents large files from being committed.
    
```8:8:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
```


### 2. `psf/black`

`black` is an uncompromising Python code formatter. It ensures consistent code style across the project.


```10:15:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.7.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3.9
        args: ["--config=pyproject.toml"]
```


-   **`black`**: Automatically formats Python code to adhere to the `black` style.
    -   `language_version`: Specifies the Python version (`python3.9`).
    -   `args`: Passes additional arguments to `black`, in this case, using the configuration from `pyproject.toml`.

### 3. `pycqa/isort`

`isort` is a utility to sort Python imports alphabetically and automatically separate them into sections.


```17:21:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.12.0
    hooks:
      - id: isort
        args: ["--settings-path=pyproject.toml"]
```


-   **`isort`**: Sorts imports in Python files.
    -   `args`: Passes additional arguments to `isort`, using the configuration from `pyproject.toml`.

### 4. `pycqa/flake8`

`flake8` is a tool for enforcing code style and complexity checks.


```23:29:python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
        additional_dependencies:
          ["flake8-docstrings", "flake8-import-order", "flake8-quotes"]
        args: ["--config=pyproject.toml"]
```


-   **`flake8`**: Checks Python code for style violations and complexity issues.
    -   `additional_dependencies`: Specifies additional plugins for `flake8`, including `flake8-docstrings`, `flake8-import-order`, and `flake8-quotes`.
    -   `args`: Passes additional arguments to `flake8`, using the configuration from `pyproject.toml`.

## Installation and Usage

To use these pre-commit hooks, you need to have `pre-commit` installed and set up in your project.

### Installation

1. Install `pre-commit`:

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the pre-commit hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

### Usage

Once installed, the hooks will run automatically before each commit. If any hook fails, the commit will be aborted, and you will need to address the issues before committing again.

You can also run the hooks manually against all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Configuration

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file defines the configuration for each hook. You can customize the behavior of the hooks by modifying this file. For example, you can change the arguments passed to `black` or `isort`, or add more hooks from other repositories.

## Notes

-   The `black` and `isort` configurations are specified in `pyproject.toml`, which is not included in the provided snippets. Ensure that this file is properly configured for your project.
-   The `flake8` configuration is also expected to be in `pyproject.toml`, and it uses additional plugins to enhance its functionality.
-   The `.flake8` file in the project root directory provides additional configuration for `flake8`, such as maximum line length and ignored errors.

```analysis-of-prompts-v0.2/.flake8
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = E203
exclude =
    venv/*,
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    build,
    dist
per-file-ignores =
    __init__.py: F401

```

## Conclusion

The pre-commit hooks in `analysis-of-prompts-v0.2` are essential for maintaining code quality and consistency. By automatically checking for and fixing common issues, they help ensure that the codebase remains clean and well-formatted. Understanding and properly configuring these hooks is crucial for contributing to the project.
