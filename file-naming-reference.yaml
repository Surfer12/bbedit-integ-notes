  naming_conventions:
    prefix_usage:
      - prefix: "code-sentinel-"
        purpose: "Identifies files directly related to the Code Sentinel project"
      - prefix: "computer-use-demo-"
        purpose: "Identifies files related to the Computer Use Demo integration"

    content_indicators:
      - suffix: "-spec"
        meaning: "Contains specifications or formal definitions"
      - suffix: "-guide"
        meaning: "Contains instructional or setup information"
      - suffix: "-integration"
        meaning: "Details integration with other systems"
      - suffix: "-overview"
        meaning: "Provides high-level project information"
      - suffix: "-brainstorm"
        meaning: "Contains exploratory ideas and planning"
      - suffix: "-deep-dive"
        meaning: "Contains detailed technical analysis"

  maintenance_guidelines:
    - "Keep prefixes consistent for related content"
    - "Use descriptive suffixes that indicate content type"
