<understanding>
The user is requesting unit tests written in the Mojo programming language.  This implies a need for example test functions demonstrating how to write tests in Mojo, likely including assertions and potentially covering different data types or scenarios.

<analysis>
The core task is to generate Mojo code that exemplifies unit testing. This will involve:
1. Defining functions to be tested.  These functions should be simple but representative of common operations.
2. Writing test functions that call the functions to be tested with specific inputs.
3. Including assertions within the test functions to verify the outputs against expected values.
4. Providing a mechanism to run the tests and report results (pass/fail).
</analysis>


<exploration>
<thought>
Mojo is still in early development, so best practices for unit testing might not be fully established.  However, drawing from common unit testing principles in other languages will be helpful.  For example, JUnit in Java or the unittest module in Python provide good models.
</thought>
<thought>
Should the example tests focus on basic data types (integers, strings, booleans) or also include more complex structures like structs or classes (when these become available in Mojo)?  It's probably best to start with basic types for clarity and then potentially expand to more complex scenarios.
</thought>
<thought>
How can the tests be made self-contained and easily runnable?  A simple `main` function to execute the tests would be beneficial.
</thought>
</exploration>


<solution_formulation>
Create a Mojo file containing:
1.  A simple function, like `add(x, y)`, to demonstrate testing.
2.  A `test_add` function that calls `add` with various inputs and asserts the results using an `assertEqual` helper function (which will also need to be defined).
3. A `main` function to run the tests.
</solution_formulation>


<solution_endpoint>
```mojo
fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:
    return x + y

fn assertEqual[T](actual: T, expected: T, message: String):
    if actual != expected:
        print("Test failed:", message)
        print("Expected:", expected)
        print("Actual:", actual)
        exit(1)

fn test_add():
    assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5, "add(2, 3) should equal 5")
    assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0, "add(-1, 1) should equal 0")

fn main():
    test_add()
    print("All tests passed!")
</solution_endpoint>

<meta_observation> The request was quite straightforward, and the solution focuses on providing a clear, concise example. The exploration phase considered potential expansions but prioritized simplicity for an initial example. <recursion_emphasis> Thinking about future enhancements like a testing framework itself requires anticipating how such a framework would be used and designed, which is a recursive layer of design thinking. </recursion_emphasis> </meta_observation>

<meta_observation_reflection> This recursive nature of design is well-documented in software engineering principles. (A citation related to iterative design processes could be added here if desired.) </meta_observation_reflection>

<architecture_analysis> There isn't a complex system architecture to analyze in this request. It's focused on a small code example. </architecture_analysis>

<yaml_structure> (No YAML structure is required for this simple example). </yaml_structure>

<emergent_framework> (The provided Mojo code example serves as the emergent framework for unit testing in this context). </emergent_framework>
